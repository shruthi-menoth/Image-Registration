# Image-Registration
The goal of this project is to use MATLAB to implement an end-to-end image registration system, which can align image pairs to a common coordinate system. The input for performing image registration consists of two images: the original image which is considered as the reference image while the image that will be aligned with the reference image is known as the sensed image. It is the mapping of the input images with respect to the reference image. The project consists of five parts mainly concerning; point feature detection, establishing correspondences, estimating the homography, RANSAC and image warping. The resulting images are found for three different cases; Standard (unnormalized) DLT, Normalized DLT and Normalized DLT + RANSAC.
